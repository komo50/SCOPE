# SCOPE
SCOPE - Sentiment. Compliance. Outlook. Performance. Evaluation. - is an AI-powered investment screener that evaluates public companies across financials, sentiment, and policy impact to support smarter, faster decision-making.


SCOPE evaluates public companies across three key dimensions:
Financial Performance, Market Sentiment, and Regulatory Environment — then delivers a clear, explainable verdict:
✅ Invest | ⚠️ Watchlist | ❌ Avoid.

This project combines my interests in finance, business, and policy to build a more holistic view of company risk and opportunity.
	
 - From my finance training, I’ve learned how institutional investors evaluate fundamentals like liquidity, leverage, and margins.
 - From my work in government affairs, I’ve seen how policy, from subsidies to antitrust probes, can significantly shape company performance.
 - From following news and media, I’ve observed how sentiment drives investor behavior and often signals market shifts.

SCOPE automates this analysis using APIs and large language models (LLMs), helping investment analysts, venture capitalists, and researchers flag risks and opportunities more efficiently.

Disclaimer: This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

SCOPE is currently an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) and there are known areas for future iteration:
 - Financial Ratio Tuning: Different industries have different healthy benchmarks. Currently, rules are generalized across sectors.
 - News Source Quality: The free-tier news API used in this version can include lower-quality sources; paid or curated feeds would improve reliability.
 - Policy Signal Tracking: Ideally, government-related insights would come from scraping trusted sources (e.g., SEC, FTC, Fed), but this is currently unsolved.
